Hi, I’m @ivanUkasKorac

📚I'm a student at the Faculty of electrotechnics and comuputer science (FER) in Zagreb, Croatia.

💻In my repositories you will find some of the projects I created while I was studying:
  - machine learning algorithm which implements ID3 - decision tree learning
  - password manager program with implemented safety features
  - arbitrage betting scraper service for two Croatian betting sites

🧮As you can  see I have a big interest in computer science and am mostly interested in creating algorithms and complicated programs.
 
👨‍💻While I was studying I became really good at Object Oriented Programming, especially in Java.

🧬🔐Currently I'm mostly interested in Machine Learning and Computer security, Cybersecurity, Security of applications etc., and would love to try and implement both of those in my next project.
