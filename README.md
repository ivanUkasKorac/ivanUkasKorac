Hi, I’m @ivanUkasKorac

I'm a student at the Faculty of electrotechnics and comuputer science (FER) in Zagreb, Croatia.

In this git repository you will find some of the projects I created while I was studying:
  - machine learning algorithm which implements ID3 - decision tree learning
  - password manager program with implemented safety features
  - arbitrage betting scraper service for two Croatian betting sites

As you can  see I have a big interest in computer science and am mostly interested in creating algorithms and complicated programs.

While I was studying I became really good at Objest Oriented Programming, especially in Java.

Currently I'm mostly interested in Machine Learning and Computer security, Cybersecurity, Security of applications, and would love to try and implement both of those in my next project.
